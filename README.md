<h2 style="margin-top: 2rem">ðŸ¥… The Goal</h2>
<p>To make the job search process more efficient and effective for both job seekers and employers by providing a centralized location for job listings and job seeker profiles.<p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 2rem">ðŸš¶ Walkthrough</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem">Sign-Up/ Sign-In</h3>
<p>Upon arriving at the application, users are presented with the option to create an account in order to utilize the full range of its features. Alternatively, users who already have an account may select the login button to be redirected to the sign in page.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem">Homepage</h3>
<p>After creating an account or logging in, the user will be directed to the home page, which features an index of all current job listings created by employers. Selecting any of these listings will redirect the user to the details page, where the full job description may be viewed.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem">Job Details and Applying</h3>
<p>On the details page, users are able to fully examine the job summary, requirements, and qualifications for the selected listing. To apply, users may simply press the apply button located at the bottom of the page. It is worth noting that the original poster and any applicants who have already applied will not be eligible to submit additional applications.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem">Submitting and The Profile Page</h3>
<p>Finally applying to a job listing, the user will be redirected to their account page (if they are not already there). On this page, users can view a list of all the job postings to which they have applied, including their most recent application. Employers, on the other hand, will be able to view a list of all job listings they have posted, with the option to delete any of them as needed.</p>
